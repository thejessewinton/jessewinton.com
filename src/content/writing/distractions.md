I have realized that my desire to live fully in the moment, avoiding all distractions when across from someone who I care to be fully with, is undermined by a lack of true _presence,_ presence being a place of creation.

With the prevalence of smart phones, smart watches, we’ve turned the idea of _distraction_ into anything electronic; buzzing, beeps, vibrations. An _empty_ mind, one free from these distractions, is a _present_ mind. But in this we’ve neglected to remember that presence, _distraction-free_ engagement with another human being should not be a place not of _emptiness_, but rather of fullness, all synapses of the brain firing; the _how_ of this is the key, residing in _memory._

Moments pass; we sit in a restaurant across from someone who we truly care to sit across from in a restaurant, and we allow ourselves to focus only on that moment, only on what is happening as it happens. But in this, I believe, we neglect to allow our emptied, distraction-free brains to make memories, choosing instead to be so fully present that we forget the important reality of the human condition, which is longevity. Being fully present should not negate one from living in the moment for themselves and allowing the mind to have meaningful distractions in the present that will spark joy in the future. In giving your attention to others, turn it towards yourself. What do you smell? What does her nose do when she laughs? How do you feel, seated in the chair across? What are the sensations you’re experiencing; the gust of a fan on the ceiling, or air from the outside as someone new enters the building? Are you truly present, or simply acting out the motions of being present to impress others with your ability to divorce from technology? When you leave this moment, will it continue exist in real ways? Will it truly live in you, or simply become another something that you vaguely recall.

We should not seek to be free from distraction; rather, our distractions should be tempered and focused towards creating memories that will be fodder for happiness in the future. Distraction is not the enemy, lack of focus is.

Take _first_ moment _every_ moment.
