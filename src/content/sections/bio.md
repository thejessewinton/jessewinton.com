Hi I'm Jesse, and I'm an actor, writer, and musician. I love telling good stories, and I'm working on a few plays (more on that TBA). As a musician I've won over a dozen California & Western U.S. flat-picking championships.


In my free time you can find me studying political theory and public policy. You might also be able to catch me working out, although you'll have to be quick as I'm very fast.


I listed a couple of my favorites roles here, but you should take a look at my full resum√©.
